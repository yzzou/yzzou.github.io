### Brief Bio

I started learning math after graduating from Shandong University, Weihai. I completed a master degree in applied mathematics at Stony Brook University. I had some work experience in an investment company as a quant. I am now a graduate student in traditional mathematics at Texas A&M University.

### Research Interests

My previous experience was about PDEs. Nevertheless, I have broad interests in math especially in the “bridges” between different fields. Recently, I am interested in algebraic analysis or D-modules.
